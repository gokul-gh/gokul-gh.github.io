* About
- This is the code of my [[https://gokul-gh.github.io/][personal website]].
- daisyui and tailwindcss are used for styling.  Earlier this used to be plain [[https://github.com/gokul-gh/gokul-gh.github.io/tree/68d32be32110bce16acdea656106442c5c715ff0][html and css]].

* Development setup
Firstly, check installation of Node.js. (I would recommend [[https://asdf-vm.com/][asdf plugin manager]] for installation as it can install multiple version of multiple languages in $HOME directory)

Clone the repository
=https://github.com/gokul-gh/gokul-gh.github.io.git=

Install the necessary dependencies
~bun install~

Run the tailwind build process
=bunx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch=

This should make my website run in your local environment.  If faced with any troubles, please refer to the respective documentation.
