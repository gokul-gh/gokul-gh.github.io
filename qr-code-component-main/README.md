## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Till now, I have learned html and css using mdn and some websites. Frontend Mentor is where I built first project. This project has been a challenging since I'm new to frontend projects.  Learning frontend by theory seemed to be easy but the practical implementation seems hard than I expected. While starting this project, I have no idea where to start. I was blank and it took me one day to understand what's to be done.  

### Continued development

I'm looking to develop more projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/) - This helped me to know the values need to be used with css elements.
